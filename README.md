# LR-SCI

This repository contains code and example scripts for a linear response selected configuration interaction (LR-SCI) implementation, described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02949.

We provide example scripts for computing polarizabilities (`polarizability.py`), damped response `damped-response.py`, and spin-spin coupling constant calculations `sscc.py`.
